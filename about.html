    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I just recently turned 18 and graduated from Magee Secondary school last june. I like badminton, piano, and video games. Especially the nintendo zelda series and league of legends. 
     I learnt piano and saxophone and started piano when I was in grade 2. I started saxophone in grade 5 but I played it in high school in band, orchestra, and I was in an early morning jazz band for a couple years.
    Then I dropped out of the because it started at 7:30 and i live in burnaby and my schools in kerrisdale. But I also just was not enjoying it and I find it very difficult to do something for that long that requires practice and commitment when you do not like it. So I dropped it after 2 years.</p>
